## Tech Stack
- Chakra UI:
  - I thought this was a good option due to its ease of use, their components are accessible out of the box which makes it a lot easier to focus on the requirements of the task
  - Composable
  - Highly adopted, so there is an established community for troubleshooting
  - Good documentation
- Apollo Client: 
  - To be honest I chose this client due to its popularity, so there is an established community for troubleshooting
  - Integrated cache which is very useful to optimise how many requests we are making when we toggle topics
  - Great dev tools
  - Good documentation
